# RCL Consensus 

This directory holds the types and classes needed
to connect the generic consensus algorithm to the
sunnycoind-specific instance of consensus.

  * `RCLCxTx` adapts a `SHAMapItem` transaction.
  * `RCLCxTxSet` adapts a `SHAMap` to represent a set of transactions.
  * `RCLCxLedger` adapts a `Ledger`.
  * `RCLConsensus` is implements the requirements of the generic 
    `Consensus` class by connecting to the rest of the `sunnycoind`
    application.
